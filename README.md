# Counter

The stepper functionality has been disabled and the code has been forked to create a persistent, perpetual website counter. The functionality of a stepper is still present but must be reenabled by putting back the external JS code. The counter and the script tag can be placed into any site as a perpetual website tracker/counter. No need for an external one from another site, you can now have your own! The counter is now a button to link to any other site and must be taken out also to reenable the manual stepper functionality.
